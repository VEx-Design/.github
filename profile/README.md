# 🚀 Welcome to **VEx Design** 🔭

**Virtual Experiment Design (VEx Design)** is an advanced software solution for designing and simulating laser systems in quantum research. It streamlines the process of laser equipment layout, reduces computational overhead, and provides systematic organization. By simulating experiments in a virtual environment, researchers can save time and resources while ensuring precision before real-world implementation.
