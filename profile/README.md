# Welcome to **VEx Design** 🔭

**Virtual Experiment Design (VEx Design)** is an advanced software solution for designing and simulating laser systems in quantum research. It streamlines the process of laser equipment layout, reduces computational overhead, and provides systematic organization. By simulating experiments in a virtual environment, researchers can save time and resources while ensuring precision before real-world implementation.


## Key Features

- **Efficient Laser System Design** – Streamline the arrangement and setup of laser components.
- **Virtual Experimentation** – Simulate real-world setups without the high costs and risks.
- **Custom Equipment Definition** – Define new components with unique properties for advanced research.
- **Enhanced Collaboration** – Facilitate teamwork among researchers, students, and professors.
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Intuitive design for quick learning and efficient workflow.
